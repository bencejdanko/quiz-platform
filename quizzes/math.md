- [x] $2x$
- [ ] $x$
- [ ] $x^3$
- [ ] $2$

Solve the following quadratic equation:

$$
x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
$$

What are the roots?
- [x] $x = 2$ and $x = 3$
- [ ] $x = 1$ and $x = 6$
- [ ] $x = -2$ and $x = -3$

In a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$, what is the length of the hypotenuse $c$?
- [x] $c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
- [ ] $c = a + b$
- [ ] $c = a^2 + b^2$
